LensPeer Automation Script
This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to interact with the LensPeer API. It is used to automatically send messages to LensPeer profiles by fetching profile data from the community page via GraphQL queries. The script also includes a machine learning component for calculating engagement scores to prioritize which profiles should receive messages.

Description
The automation script automates the process of:

Fetching LensPeer profiles using the GraphQL API (community page).
Sending messages to these profiles.
Storing profile information in an SQLite database to track which profiles have already been messaged.
Predicting engagement scores using a basic machine learning model (currently a placeholder) to target more relevant profiles.
The main goal is to optimize the outreach process on LensPeer by automating message sending, while using engagement scores to prioritize outreach.

How It Works
Profile Fetching:

The script uses a GraphQL query to fetch profiles from the community page on LensPeer.
Profiles' information, such as followers, following, and interests, are stored in a local SQLite database.
Message Sending:

For each fetched profile that hasnâ€™t been messaged yet, the script sends a predefined message via the LensPeer API.
After successfully sending a message, the profile's information is stored in the database to prevent duplicate messages.
Machine Learning for Engagement Scoring:

The engagement score is calculated using a RandomForestClassifier (currently a placeholder model).
The script ranks profiles by engagement score, prioritizing those with higher scores for messaging.
Logging:

Logs are generated for each stage of the process (e.g., fetching profiles, sending messages, and errors).
What's Working
Database Setup: The script sets up an SQLite database (sent_profiles.db) to store profiles and wallets, preventing duplicate messaging.

GraphQL Integration: The script successfully constructs a GraphQL query to fetch profiles from the LensPeer community page.

Profile Storing and Message Sending: The script sends messages to profiles and stores the data of sent profiles in the database.

Logging: The script logs various events, such as fetching profiles, sending messages, and encountering errors.

Current Issues
API Errors: The script encounters 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to fetch profiles from the community page. This issue could be due to incorrect API usage or server-side issues.

Wallet Data Fetching: There is a 400 Client Error when trying to fetch wallets. This indicates that the request format or endpoint might be incorrect and needs to be revised.

Authentication Token: The script currently requires a manually provided authentication token (auth_token). Automating the process to retrieve and refresh the token needs to be implemented.

Machine Learning Model: The engagement score prediction is currently using a placeholder RandomForestClassifier. A proper model needs to be trained and integrated to improve engagement scoring.

Retry Logic: Although the script retries fetching profiles three times, it still fails after multiple attempts, suggesting the need for further investigation into the cause of the 500 Internal Server Error.

To Be Fixed
Fix API Calls:
Investigate and resolve the 500 Internal Server Error during profile fetching.
Fix the 400 Client Error when fetching wallets.
Improve Authentication Handling:
Automate the retrieval of the authentication token using browser-based reverse engineering.
Implement Proper Machine Learning Model:
Replace the placeholder RandomForestClassifier with a properly trained model for predicting engagement scores.
