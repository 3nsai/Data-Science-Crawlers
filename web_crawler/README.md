This python file is the web crawler. Keep updating, but you can use the file to catch information of user name, address, price...etc. 
I am still testing it, and will make it easier usesable in the future. 
This file will visit D3 website and then catch the information from MarketplaceFeed and SearchRecentListings from GraphQL.
If you want to use it, make sure the url and save_path are correct.
